<p><b>My top host pick is FatCow. Their website is much easier to navigate and get information from which implies that the host will also be easy to use. It felt like FatCow is offering more hosting services than the other two as well, especially important ones like photo galleries and email. The cost is also reasonable for such a service. More importantly, it appears to be the full price, whereas Bluehost and Hostgator were offering 'hidden upgrades' for stuff like Domain Services that I found after navigating through their websites. Finally, FatCow also has a great name for its 24/7 customer support: The Friendly Moo Crew Support.</b></p>
