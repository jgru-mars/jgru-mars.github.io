		<p>Dinosaurs were lizard like so Winter was interesting for them. They wore such fluffy clothing you could just not help but hug them!
		Dinosaurs loved to play in the snow and make snow dinos, their favorite to make was the Ankylosaurus because it was just the right shape, low to the ground and rather bulky so the shape was easy to make.
		The dinos favorite past time on these cold nights was to go knit in front of the fireplace. Knitting was done by every type of dino, even the T-Rex, though it was hard for them because their arms
		were so tiny!</p>
