		<p>Dinosaurs loved the summer, it was warm and relaxing. One of their favorite things to do in the summer was to assemble large piles of wood and leaves and burn them. They would then dance around the fires
		singing songs like Baby Shark and Baby Dino. Another of their favorite things to do in the summer was to set off fireworks! Summer was such a warm time that dinosaurs all enjoyed it, though it did make
		hunting a rather sweaty endeavor. Despite this, everything was green and vibrant with life. The only bad thing was that there was a ton of bugs! Poor T-Rex though, his arms were so tiny he was not able to 
		slap the bugs out of the sky!
