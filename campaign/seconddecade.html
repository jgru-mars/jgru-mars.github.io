		<h2>Imperial News!</h2>
		<p>War and Trade! The Royal Family continues to flex their wrists by leading armies against the Eygptians to the south! They also continue to construct numerous different buildings to improve trade, such as trading stations, roads, and ports! One has to wonder
		if they are a little to keen on keeping the title of Richest Faction in the world? The Royal Family has produced two more able bodied generals to lead our armies, Zeuxis and Gyras! These two will hopefully follow in the footsteps of their elders! The military has
		been doing a glorious job this Decade! They have taken two cities, one of which is Jerusalem! One of the most important endeavors this Decade however is the capture of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus! This great wonder has improved the construction speed of the Empire!
		Our glory and power grow every year and our enemies tremble before our might!

		<h2>Construction!</h2>
		<p>Construction was once again very productive this next decade! Most notably, shipwright was established in Antioch. Now the Empire will have better trade and the ability to create better warships. The great city Selecuia finally were able to make paved
		roads, which also increase trade. Our empire is built on trade and the pillage of cities! More barracks have been constructed across the Empire as well, which we know will help replace the units lost in the costly war with Eygpt! Numerous trading stations
		have also been constructed in various cities, thus our trade opportunities are increasing! The people love that the authorities are listening to their suggestions on what to build each year! We should keep doing this for it is not harming our Empire in the least!</p>

		<h2>Military!</h2>
		<p>Another bloody Decade! The Royal family are literally fighting with their soldiers! What a sight! The family member Cleitos stepped up and tore a rebel army to pieces that was camped outside the city of Susa. The countryside there is now doing much better 
		with the enemy army not pillaging anymore! On to other news, Polyperchon has finally captured Halicarnassus! The Mausoleum is ours! In addition to these great military achievements the Admiral Euthydemus has won his first battle at sea! We are winning not on just 
		the land but also on the sea! As for Judaea, Rhosus has battled through many a battle this decade there! But alas! Near the end of the decade he suceceeded to capture Jerusalem! Let us hope we hold it, not that it is besieged at the end of this decade! Our military
		is unmatched! However, it is rather concerning that a army from Pontus has appeared in our lands to the north! We must prepare for a possible 2 fronts!
		</p>

		<div class="diplomacy">

		<h2>Diplomacy!</h2>
		<p>Diplomacy has been rather plentiful! We have made a alliance with our other neighbor to the north, Armenia! Let us hope they are faithful and worthy of our generous offer of a alliance. We have made peace with the Parthian Empire when we made a aliiance with
		Pontus a while back thus we are currently only at war with Eygpt and the various Rebel armies roaming the countryside pillaging. Rather politely, the Parthian Empire has extended the offer of trade rights and the share of map information on thier part, such a generous
		offer! We accept graciously! Scythia has also been met and trade rights and map inforamtion has been shared between our two glorious empires!
