		<h2>Imperial News!</h2>
		<p>War and Money! It seems that the Imperial Family is more interested in the plunder and glory of war than the lazy life of the home. But it is good that they are ready for war, for Eygpt has attacked our southern borders! And Parthia looms to the east!</p>
		<p>The royal family seems to be quite busy this decade. Two marriages have made the family stronger then ever despite the death of our leader, Antiochus! Now the faction is down to only 10 surviving adult members! The husband of our amazing Aspasia, 
		Anaksarxos of Rhosus seems ready to fill the shoes of Antiochus after his glorious victory in the capture of Sidon. Though they lost the head of the family, they are not brought to their knees!</p>
		<p>The people are happy! Despite the heavy taxes that this new decade brought and continued throughout, they are still glad with the Royal family's antics. There is very small corruption and the money is going to good places, such as the building of a shrine
		to Dionysus, the god of wine! We love wine and the plunders of the war with Parthia and Eygpt! During this decade the Seleucid Empire also recived the notable achievements of Richest Faction, Largest Faction, and Most Advanced Faction of all the Civilizations in the world!</p>

		<h2>Construction!</h2>
		<p>Construction was absolutely fantastic this decade! The greatest accomplishment being that every city built a wall, at least a wooden one. This extra protection against enemies is a welcome one! In addition to the walls, the authorities have also constructed
		trading stations throughout the Seleucid Empire in various places. Some of these being Damascus and Antioch. Numerous Barracks have been constructed as well, most likely to rise up to the sudden demand for better soldiers and more recruitment during this decade.
		However, the people have noted that the most important construction done was the roads being built throughout the Empire and the farms! This was a great decade for construction in the glorious Seleucid Empire!

		<h2>Military!</h2>
		<p>News on the military is very fruitful. The Empire has been spewing out soldiers by the hundreds! We are ready for war! The military decided to not abandon the city of Sardis so that the soldiers could move to the city of Tarsus to defend it against possible
		invasion from Pontus. Fortunately, after the alliance with Pontus they realized their desicsion was a good one. They were able to keep the Temple of Artemis by the city of Sardis and then travel to siege the city of Halicarnassus after a brief buildup of soldiers
		in Sardis. Of course they had to deal with a rebel army pillaging the land of Lycia first before they could lay the siege but that battle was small and a expected victory! After Eygpt declared war on the Empire they moved a army down to capture Sidon, which it did
		finally in the span of a year! The army mostly consisted of Militia Hoplites. The battle for Sidon was a glorious victroy, two Egyptian armies went against our one with one Hoplite reinforcement. The causalities of our army was extremely low, which shows the superiority of our soldiers!</p>

		<h2>Diplomacy!</h2>
		<p> Diplomany has been hectic this decade to say the least! In the beginning of the decade, the ruling family was able to secure trade rights and the share of map information with our southern neighbors, Eygpt. Scarcely two years later, we decalred war on 
		the Parthian Empire by attacking the city called Susa. Depsite this, we were able to establish diplomatic relations with the Greek Cities and Armenia, obtaining trade rights and map information with both of them. Near the end of the decade we were pleased to
		receive the offer of a alliance with Pontus, which also came with trade rights and map information. We graciously accepted this alliance mostly because we did not need a war to the north with one brewing on the east with the Parthian Empire and one on our southern
		borders with Eygpt. Our fears were confirmed near the end of the decade when Eygpt declared war on us and blocaked the port of Antioch. Thus by the end of the decade we are in a alliance with Pontus and at war with Eygpt and the Parthian Empire.
