		<h2>Imperial News!</h2>
		<p>Thus comes an end the bloody four decades! The Royal family wants to announce that Kassandros has finally come of age to wage battle. Not a moment too soon either! Our great military continues to conquer lands and peoples! Soon there will not be a single 
		part of the Seleucid Empire that the sun sets or does not belong to the Empire!Onwards to Thebes! Onwards to Greece! Onwards to Rome! When Rome falls, there is nothing left that could possibly offer a challenge to our great civilization! Soon our elephants and chariots
		will be roaming the countrysides of every providence under the sun!

		<h2>Construction!</h2>
		<p>The construction goes well this Decade, just like the decades before! A sure sign of the greatness of the Seleucid Empire! Besdies the ports and various repairs done to captured cities, the great city of Selecuia has built calvary stables which have enabled
		the Empire to recruit Elephants! These majestic creatures will strike fear in the hearts of our enemies! The Empire still is keeping its citizens happy despite the heavy taxes. It is very good that at least a significant amount of the money is going to buildnig
		great buildings and not just to the upkeep of the military!

		<h2>Military!</h2>
		<p>War still runs in the veins of the Royal Family! The daring Anaksarxos of Rhosus has ventured where we dared not go before! Into the very heart of Eygpt! He has fought a magnificant battle at the doorstep of the city of Memphis. Despite receiving heavy casulties,
			Anaksarxos then proceeded to sack the city of Memphis and claim it for the glory of the Seleucid Empire! The war with Eygpt will be a quick and sudden end! However, the war with Pontus is just starting. We have captured the city of Mazaka, taking little loses.
			But the Pontic army had gone around and is now sieging the city of Tarsus once again! Our armies are mobilizing to defend our great city before they can attack its depleted reserves! The Pontic people will come to regret their acts of war and

		<h2>Diplomacy!</h2>
		<p>Diplomacy is once again all over the place. The Empire started the decade at war with nobody but Pontus which was came as a suprise. But that peace came to an end when we attacked the city of Mazaka in the north thus angering the Pontic people more. Eygpt
		was next when Anaksarxos attacked the city of Memphis. No peace for the Egyptians lest they rebuild their armies! The Greek Cities have declared war on the Empire! The Empire was able to secure trade rights with both Thrace and Macedonia during this decade. Map information also was shared around us all. Our diplomats
		are extrodinary individuals to be so successful in their negotiations!
