		<h2>Imperial News!</h2>
		<p>Enemies at all sides! The beginning of this Decade was a bleak one with enemies on all sides! War with Pontus, Parthia, and Eygpt! Luckily, Parthia gave up after a year and made a alliance with our glorious Empire! During this Decade, the Empire
		has once again reclaimed the titles of Most Advanced Faction and Strongest Faction! The people do not see these titles going away any time soon! The Royal family has been more quiet this decade except for the capture of Palmyra which one of the new members
		showed his worth by taking it with small casulties and the marriage of our beloved Orthia to Abronychus of Arsinoe! Farming is somehow beating our trade for income despite the Royal family pumping so much resources towards increasing trade! Our Empire is still doing strong and even in the darkest times, no Faction can bring us down!

		<h2>Construction!</h2>
		<p>Construction is really getting out there this decade! A couple Governor Villas have been constructed for the cities getting larger, a sure sign of prosperity and economic growth! In addition to this, sewers have been built for the first time ever for the Empire!
		This is exciting news! Soon we will all be smelling so much better! A couple more shrines have been built as well, no other god except for Dionysus of course! We love wine! In fact, I think every one of the cities in the Empire has a shrine to this guy! We are so crazy!
		Crop Rotation has also been played with in this decade, most likely why farming is the greatest form of income in our Empire so far! The people continue to love the decisions from the authorities on what to build to greater help the city!

		<h2>Military!</h2>
		<p> Our military once again has been very busy this Decade! We have taken defended our cities twice on both the north and south parts of the Empire! Tarsus and Jerusalem have prevailed! Pontus and Eygpt are no match for our armies! All Eygpt can do is blockade
		our ports, which is getting to be annoying since it is ruining the flow of trade. The Empire is assembling a massive fleet to combat this nuisance! The Empire has once again declared war on the Parthian Empire and took the city of Dumatha in one fell swoop! Right away
		the Parthians begged for a ceasefire after this extrodinary feat! Palmyra has also been captured by our armies! Our land grows every decade, I doubt any other Faction will be able to withstand our power!
		</p>

		<div class="diplomacy">
			<p><a href="#" class="big-link" data-reveal-id="myModal" data-animation="fade"><img src="diplomancythird.png" class="rome"></a><p>
		<h2>Diplomacy!</h2>
		<p>Diplomacy has been rather bleak this decade. Most importantly, Pontus has declared war on our Empire. Now we have to worry about more fronts to fight on! Our military is spread thin. In the beginning of the Decade we lost all of our allies, since they
		wer also allies with the treachorous Pontus! But at the end of the decade, the Parthian Empire extended a offer of a ceasefire. We graciously accepted, we will need help curving the growing Armenian armies afterall. We are now allies wtih Parthia and they 
		also gave us trade rights and map information. What a gift! They are worthy of being our allies! I just hope they are okay with our Empire controlling two of their former cities.
