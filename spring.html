		<p>Dinosaurs loved the season of Spring! It was warm and cozy, just perfect for hopping through the green fields under blue skies as the flowers sprung up and the trees budded with flowers and leaves.
		Spring is a joyous time full of energy and beginnings. It was usually warmer than winter too, so the dinos could hunt easier without getting cold. They only need some sweaters and sometimes if it was warm
		enough, they could wear their Spring dresses or have barbecues! During this warm time, the dinos loved to build out of Legos and collect flowers. But the T-Rex had a sad experience with these activities. Their tiny arms had a hard time
		reaching down!
