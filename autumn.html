		<p>Dinosaurs thought Autumn was funny. The Dilophosuars always tried to tell people that it was actually Fall and not Autumn, because leaves would fall down not Autumn down. Of course this is very
		logical and many debates were sparked in the Great Dino Club, the Brachiosaurus always tried to put their foot down in protest of the folly of the Dilophosuars. They were always saying how the Dilophosuars just
		did not know any better since they were just uneducated idiots from North America! The Dilophosuars always countered by reminding the Brachiosaurus that they too lived in North America! Of course, the T-Rex
		tried to raise his hands to get his point across but nobody saw because his arms were so tiny!
