	<h1>My Research On State Websites</h1>

	<h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_new">Alaska!</a></h1>
	<h4>My favorite website is the Alaskan one. The link is above on the left!</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>I liked the background color of the Alaskan website, on my PC screen it took up a third on the left and a third on the right. Unfortuantly, this cool feature is lost on the phone. However, I also liked the golden theme of the top menu because 
		it was pretty cool with the dark blue background.</li>
		<li>The main menu on top, the one in blue, has a ton of useful links within the website which are all pretty much self explanatory to me. This made it very easy to navigate. They even helpfully
		seperated the website's resources so that it would be easier for visitors to find info that would apply more to them.</li>
		<li>As mentioned above, the website is formatted differently for different screens. On my PC the main part is only a third of the screen, but is centered. On my phone the main part took up the entire screen and I could not see the dark blue background anymore.</li>
		<li>One really cool thing about the Alaskan website is that they had a kid's corner! There it displayed all these cool facts about Alaska, such as the fact that there is are than 70 potentially active volcanoes in Alaska.</li>
		<li><b>Thus, the Alaskan state website is my favorite because it is easy to navigate, lots of information, has a cool blue background on PC, and a map showing how big Alaska really is compared to the rest of the United States.</b></li>
	</ul>

	<h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/" target="_new">Iowa!</a></h1>
	<h4>My second favorite website is the Iowa one.</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Iowa also had a very similar dark blue background to the Alaskan website. I like this color. But they also had a background image that would not move when I scrolled down through the website.</li>
		<li>The main menu was not bad, it had some good information on it and is easy to navigate. However, they should have added a much easier to find section devoted just to out of state visitors in my opinion like Alaska did.</li>
		<li>I felt like there is not much of a difference between the mobile version and the PC version.</li>
		<li>The one really cool thing about this website that stood out to me is that it listed the state flower, bird, and tree. I wish the other websites would have displayed these as well on the first page, would have added to the coolness factors.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" target="_new">Vermont!</a></h1>
	<h4>My third website is Vermont's.</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Vermont did not have a cool background color going for it but I did like the green headlighter's whenever I hovered over the options in the middle of the screen.</li>
		<li>Vermont had a okay main menu. I felt like it was easy to navigate and was particuarly pleased to find out that they did have a vistor section under the explore option with information regarding historic sites and state parks.</li>
		<li>There was not much difference between the mobile and PC versions.</li>
		<li>The really cool thing I liked about the Vermont website is the info on historic sites. They had a lot of historic sites that I never had known about.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov/" target="_new">Tennessee!</a></h1>
	<h4>My fourth website is Tennessee.</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Tennessee also employed that really cool dark blue color throughout their site. And it wasn't just on the home page.</li>
		<li>The main menu worked mostly fine. I was able to navigate rather well. However, at one point I was not able to get back to the home page even when I was clicking on the house icon in the menu. I did not like this.</li>
		<li>Nicely enough, the website on PC and Mobile both had the cool blue color and were extremely close in detail.</li>
		<li>The cool thing I found about this website is the fact that they had a section for homeschooling. I was homeschooled before college so I felt like this was a nice touch.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1><a href="https://www.ok.gov/" target="_new">Oklahoma!</a></h1>
	<h4>My least favorite website is Oklahoma's.</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The background felt a little over with the out of focus grass field on PC but they did use that cool dark blue color in some spots.</li>
		<li>I could not find the main menu on this website so I am assuming that there is none.</li>
		<li>The mobile and PC versions of the website was practically the same. Except for the fact that the mobile is thankfully missing the out of focus grass background.</li>
		<li>The cool things about this website was the cool name, ok.gov, and that they used the dark blue in some spots.</li>
		<li><b>This was my least favorite website mostly because it did not give much information at all and has out of focus grass in the background.</b></li>
	</ul>
