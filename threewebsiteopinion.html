	<h1>Three Website Opinion Article: Two good, one bad</h1>
	<h2>These all take up half a page in Microsoft Word, thus overall it is a page and a half</h2>
	
	<h1><a href="https://www.StarWars.com/" target="_new">StarWars.com</a></h1>
	<h3>My first good website is StarWars.com<h3>
	
	<h3>	I like StarWars.com because everything basically is a link to something on the website instead of being just unclickable pictures, I think that is cool that they have a lot of content. With even 
	some image links within another image link. I also really like that they put a funny comment in when I checked the source code using the developer tools in Google Chrome. The funny comment is 
	May the Source be with you, which is hilarious! StarWars.com uses html, head, body, divs, scripts, img, and iframes to complete its website. The website itself looks very clean 
	and modern but I was expecting more in the source code. Even though the website has a lot of apparent columns in groups of three and four at times I can not find where they made them in the source code. 
	However, I do like their layout in the website, with it being always changing appropriately as you scroll down. I can navigate really well on this website, it makes a lot of sense. There is a menu that 
	is correctly titled and there is no confusing links since they all are a image that helps explain exactly where the link is going. The major colors that StarWars.com uses are black, yellow, blue, and 
	with a little bit of red on some start buttons. The color black makes a lot of sense since Star Wars takes place in space a lot. Yellow is usually the color of the logo so it also makes sense to have on 
	the website. The rest of the colors are random and just help with the experience since black and yellow should not be the only colors on the screen. I really like that their background is basically a 
	black screen with stars on it, fits with the Star Wars feel. A couple of the image links are not even boxes too, they have a unique shape to them which is really cool. I also like that the first link 
	image is constantly changing to something new so it must be on a timer. One little thing I noticed is that there is no home button in the menu and instead the link back to the home page is the logo on
	top of the screen which has a scrolling effect and stays with the user as they scroll down. They also chose a good font for the website. The creators were going for a Star Wars feel which I feel they
	captured perfectly.

	<h1><a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/" target="_new">SpaceBattles.com</a></h1>
	<h3>My second website that I liked is SpaceBattles.com</h3>
	
	<h3>The next website that I like is the SpaceBattles.com. This website is very simple and not very confusing at all. It is well organized with descriptive links under another organizational description. 
	It also has a scrolling effect and the menu follows the user as they scroll down which is very cool. I also like that the menu has a hover color. I also like that since this is a forum website they 
	put the name of the user that last edited each forum. The website looks clean and modern and the source code is very neat and organized with html, head, body, divs, and scripts. I believe that they 
	might be using tables on this website, it is either that or they colored in a tiny padding around some of the boxes inside the descriptive links. The layout makes perfect sense to me, it is very 
	organized and neat with the websites various page links being correctly described before you click on them. There appears to be two columns with the links to forums on one side and statistics on the 
	other side. There is a scrolling effect actually where the menu stays with you as you scroll down. The colors for SpaceBattles.com are black, green, orange, grey, and various different shades of blue. 
	Overall I think the colors are good, they are just right to not make it cringy or too dark feeling. And they got a little space vibe and futuristic vibe to them which I think was what the creators 
	were shooting for.  I like that the website allows it users to have a profile picture and a quote that appears under their comments or threads that they start on the forums. All the individual boxes 
	that they put in to organize their contents all have rounded edges which I think is very cool. They also have a option on their website for the user to change the font size of the websiteâ€™s menu and a 
	couple other things. I think that this feature is very cool and not often used. I also like the font. The creators were going for a space and futuristic feel which I feel that they adequately captured.

	<h1><a href="https://biomediaproject.com/bmp/" target="_new">biomediaproject.com</a></h1>
	<h3>My one bad website is biomediaproject.com.</h3>
	
	<h3>I dislike biomediaproject.com for its feel. I love the content but the menu just does not feel right, it should be something else instead of a black line with white text leading to places in the 
	website.  I also do not quite like that the creators put the logo under the menu either. I feel like it should be above the menu just like StarWars.com and SpaceBattles.com. Also the fact that you 
	have to scroll sideways instead of down is different too, while I do not hate it I also do not like it either. Overall it does not look modern, most likely because they were attempting to create a 
	Lego Bionicle feel, which they did not get right except for the logo. They are using html, head, body, and div elements and are not using scripts like StarWars.com or SpaceBattles.com. The layout is 
	interesting with a lot of possible columns with different image links and more in some columns than in others. The menu is easy to see and easy for me to create. I can navigate just fine in this 
	website but it needs to work on its layout some more. I think the sideways scrolling should stop and be just up and down scrolling for better viewing despite its uniqueness. In some of the pages that 
	the menu brings you too it switches to up and down scrolling but then another page will be back to the sideways. The colors are basically black, grey, and white with only the image links providing 
	any other colors. However these image links are understandable to be a different color because of their content. The color scheme is okay. The things that set this website apart from the other is that 
	it has sideways scrolling and the logo will get bigger when I navigate to the home screen and I can watch it get smaller when I go somewhere else. I like that the logo is able to blend into the 
	background nicely instead of being its own box. The creators wanted to go for a Lego Bionicle feel which they almost captured but it still needs some work.
