		<p>This website will tell a traveler all about how the dinosaurs viewed each season of the year. These being Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter! Dinosaurs had to deal with each of these seasons when they 
		lived long ago. This information that is available on this website was supplied by the Wonderful Dinosaur Bill, who is a Troodon (a very smart and small dinosaur, Bill told me Troodon's are thought to be 
		the smartest dinosaur...) Anyways, the knowledge of how dinosaurs felt about each season or the interesting things that occurred during these seasons are quite useful. Never again will you wonder what dinosaurs
		did in the winter or how sad T-Rex's are about their tiny arms!
